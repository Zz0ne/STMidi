MIDI Controller using STM32 A custom MIDI controller project built with an STM32 microcontroller. This project serves as a learning experience in ARM-based embedded development, real-time processing, and USB/MIDI communication. The goal is to create a flexible and efficient MIDI controller that can be used with DAWs, synthesizers and pedalboards.
